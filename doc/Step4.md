## Defensive Reads
### Goal
Sometime, you need to read a JSON entity from an HTTP request, but this JSON

 - may be partial
 - is untrusted
 - may be erroneous (missing attr, wrong values)

So you want to erase some specific attributes from the input JSON

The typical example is when you merge data from a creation form with data from you DB in order to create a trusted model instance that can be used and re-persisted. 

### Exercise

Using `Reads.pure`, you will force somme attributes of the mapped model to a specific value. The Reads will be generated by a function that take the replacement values as arguments.

See 4.1 and 4.2 TODOs in [Step4 source](../src/main/scala/service/Step4.scala).
Associated test suite is [Step4Spec](../src/test/scala/service/Step4Spec.scala).

## Partial Writes
### Goal
Sometime, you may want to hide a technical attribute, offer a sumerized view of a resource, or show only attributes the authorized user is allowed to see.

### Exercise

There is 2 ways of doing that.

 - by creating a Writes in which you create a `JsObject` with `Json.obj`
 - by creating an `ignore` function that create a Reads that create a kind of "empty" value. You will combine this `ignore` with other Reads using the usual `and`.
