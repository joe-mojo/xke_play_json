XKE Play JSON
==============

Learn [Play JSON](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.7.x/ScalaJson) with this hands-on exercise.

Play JSON was originally part of [Playframework](https://www.playframework.com), but is an independent lib for a long time now. So you don't need any Playframework concept or dependency to use Play JSON.
Despite that, the Play JSON doc is found in Playframework one. And on [StakOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=play+json) too.

To start, checkout `Step1` branch and follow [Step1 guide](doc/Step1.md)
